main.py is work fine
the snake.py is intentionally it is not working well
the food is not generating. there is no condition for collision between the snake and the food

1. import the necessary module first
    a. pygame
        generally used to create  a game materially like surface, sound, move, events
    b. time

    c. random
        to generate a a food position randomly
2. Define the constant that used in the whole game process
    - in my case width and height for my window or surface
    - snake_size that is initial snake size to make snake body
    - game_over and game_close game over the main loop that control the full flow
        the game_close only check if the user close with close button and display the message
    - x1 and y1 is update position of the snake they updated always when the user has an event key
    - x1_change and y1_change is a temporary position container for the snake then they added to the x1 and y1 to update the position
